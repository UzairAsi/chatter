# Requirements ðŸ“–

Most of the work needs to be done in the `Messages` components.

- Implement hooks such as `useEffect` and `useCallback` to handle events
- Scroll to the bottom of the messages list when sending/receiving a message
- Show the initial Botty message by default (can be found in `common/constants`)
- Use **sockets** to:
  - Send the user's message to Botty
  - Show a typing message when Botty is typing
  - Handle incoming Botty messages and display them
